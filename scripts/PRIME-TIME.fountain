Title: PRIME TIME 

                                                    FADE IN:
1
INT. CREDENCE GLOBAL SOLUTIONS – FIFTH FLOOR – PRIME MEETING ROOM – NIGHT

The clock reads 9:28 P.M.  
The ARTIVA PROGRAMMING TEAM files into the PRIME meeting room.  
Manager PRADEEP leads the group — junior software engineers, software engineers, and DAG team members in tow.

But the room is already full.  
The BACK OFFICE TEAM, twice their size, sits around the table, deep in discussion.  
At the head, BACK OFFICE MANAGER SANTOSH speaks to his people.

Across the room, a tense silence grows.

                              PRADEEP
               (to Santosh, polite)
               We have this room booked from 9:30 to 10:30 for Artiva training.

                              SANTOSH
               I know, but this is urgent. We started late — 
               Punithan’s meeting pushed ours back. We need more time.

FLASHBACK TO:
INT. PRIME MEETING ROOM – EARLIER – EVENING

SENIOR MANAGER PUNITHAN sits with his team from 6:30 to 7:30,  
but the discussion runs over. The BACK OFFICE TEAM waits outside,  
checking watches. Finally, they enter at 7:45, already behind schedule.

BACK TO PRESENT:

The ARTIVA team members glance at each other — they didn’t know any of this.

                              PRADEEP
               My team’s training is important too. Payment arrangement 
               workflow isn’t something we can just skip.

                              SANTOSH
               And neither is ours.

Pradeep thinks for a moment.  
He pulls out his phone, steps aside, and dials MANAGEMENT.

                              PRADEEP
               (into phone)
               Which meeting room is available now?

A pause. He listens.  

                              PRADEEP
               ORIN? First floor? Got it.

He ends the call and turns to Santosh.

                              PRADEEP
               Fine. You keep the PRIME. We’ll move to ORIN.

The ARTIVA team groans quietly, but they follow him out.

INT. CREDENCE GLOBAL SOLUTIONS – LIFT – NIGHT

Everyone crams into the lift.  
It’s slow, stopping at almost every floor.  
Only Pradeep carries a laptop bag. The rest have empty hands —  
the PCI zone on the first floor doesn’t allow books, pens, laptops, or mobiles.

                              JUNIOR ENGINEER
               (muttering)
               At this rate, the training will be halfway done before we start.

Pradeep smirks, shaking his head.

INT. ORIN MEETING ROOM – FIRST FLOOR – NIGHT

The team enters. The blast of COLD AIR hits them —  
the centralized AC is running strong.

They take their seats. Pradeep sets up his laptop at the head of the table.  
No one else has notes — just their attention.

                              PRADEEP
               Alright, payment arrangement workflow in Artiva.  
               Let’s get started.

The hum of the AC fills the quiet as he begins the session.  
Despite the delay, focus sharpens.

FADE OUT.
