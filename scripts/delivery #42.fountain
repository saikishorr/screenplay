FADE IN:

1. EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

A wet, flickering city. Neon signs blink over puddles.  
A food delivery scooter hums down a narrow street, cutting through the rain.


2. INT. Saikishor’S CAR - NIGHT

Wipers drag. The rain sounds like static.
Saikishor (early 30s), tired eyes, company jacket zipped halfway, scrolls his delivery app.  
He’s the picture of burnout — polite smile worn thin from repetition.

The phone pings.

    NEW ORDER: #42  
    Ridgemont Apartments, Unit 7B.  

He hesitates — frowns.  
The number feels familiar.

He exhales and drives off.


3. EXT. RIDGEMONT APARTMENTS - NIGHT

The building looms like a memory: faded bricks, buzzing light over the door.  
A dripping stairwell echoes each step.

Saikishor climbs, breath visible in the cold air.  
He stops at **7B**. Knocks twice.

The door opens.

Standing there is **ANOTHER Saikishor** — nearly identical, but hair longer, calmer eyes, different hoodie.

                          OTHER Saikishor
              Right on time.

A beat.

                          Saikishor
              Sorry— have we met?

                          OTHER Saikishor
              (smiles)
              Keep the change.

He closes the door.

Saikishor stares at the number again: **7B**.  
Then at his phone: “DELIVERY COMPLETE.”

He backs away, unsettled.


4. INT. Saikishor’S CAR - LATER

He scrolls through his app history, wiping rain from the screen.

Every past address... different.  
Except for the last forty-one.  
**7B, Ridgemont Apartments.**

He sits in silence, phone glowing on his face, the rain swallowing the sound.


5. INT. Saikishor’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Small, sparse, quiet. He places the bag he didn’t deliver on the counter.  
The logo is identical to the one on the bag in his flashback.

He opens the delivery — same order he always eats.

He picks at the food, uneasy.  
The rain outside keeps time with the ticking clock.


MONTAGE — DAYS PASSING

— Saikishor on his scooter, rain or shine, always stopping at **7B.**  
— Each door answer: a new version of himself — slight differences in voice, beard, posture.  
— He tries rejecting orders; they reroute automatically.  
— The app glitches, looping the same order number.  
— He stares at mirrors, camera selfies, his own delivery photo — trying to see what’s changing.  
— Saikishor driving at dawn, eyes hollow, as the notifications repeat.

    *PING.* “Order #42 – Ridgemont, 7B.”  
    *PING.* “Order #42 – Ridgemont, 7B.”


6. INT. RIDGEMONT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Saikishor stands before **7B** again. He’s soaked. Exhausted.  
He knocks — harder this time.

No answer.

He tries the handle. It turns.


7. INT. APARTMENT 7B - CONTINUOUS

The same layout as his own apartment.  
Down to the crooked photo frame.  
Stacks of old delivery bags line the walls.

He walks deeper inside, noticing **empty takeout containers** — each marked **Saikishor #** followed by a number.

He stops at the counter.  
The latest one: **Saikishor #41.**

Then a voice behind him.

                          OLDER Saikishor (O.S.)
              I told you not to come in.

Saikishor turns.

An OLDER VERSION of himself — late 40s, tired but resigned — stands in the doorway.  
Same delivery jacket. Frayed at the sleeves.

                          Saikishor
              Who are you?

                          OLDER Saikishor
              Same as you. Just... further down the route.

                          Saikishor
              This— this is some kind of joke.

                          OLDER Saikishor
              You think so every time.

Saikishor looks around. His eyes catch on dozens of **delivery receipts** pinned to the wall.  
Each one: **#42.**

                          Saikishor
              What is this place?

                          OLDER Saikishor
              A loop. You deliver yourself until you stop asking why.

                          Saikishor
              That doesn’t make sense.

                          OLDER Saikishor
              Neither does doing the same job forever and calling it living.

A silence sits heavy between them.

                          OLDER Saikishor (CONT'D)
              It’s not the food that gets delivered. It’s *us.*

Saikishor backs toward the door, breathing hard.

                          OLDER Saikishor (CONT'D)
              You can try leaving. But the app already knows you’re home.

Saikishor’s phone BUZZES in his hand.

ON SCREEN: **NEW ORDER – #43, RIDGEMONT 7B.**

The notification tone echoes, distorted.

He looks up — but the OLDER Saikishor is gone.


8. INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Saikishor steps out, trembling, clutching the phone.

He drops the delivery bag.  
It hits the floor, food spilling out like entrails.

He looks toward a rain-fogged window at the end of the hall.

His reflection appears — smiling faintly.

But Saikishor isn’t.

They lock eyes.  
The reflection raises its phone first.

FADE OUT.
